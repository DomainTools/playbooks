# DomainTools Playbooks

Playbooks and automation scripts for SOAR applications that automate incident response activities by utilizing DomainTools intelligence.

Each integrationâ€™s playbooks are in separate folders at the root of this repo. Find your integration and download the playbooks. Each one has instructions on the README of the playbook directory - be sure to read those.

Happy Hunting!
